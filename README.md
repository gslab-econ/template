Using the repository template
=============================

#### Pre-requisites:

 - Windows `cmd.exe`, Mac OS X `bash`, or Linux `bash`. 
 - [Python 2.X](https://www.python.org) (add to [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)))
 - [Stata MP](http://www.stata.com/statamp/) (add to [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)))
 - [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (add to [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)))
 - [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) (add to [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)))
 - [SCons](http://scons.org/) (Note that version 2.4.0 or later is best if using the [cache](http://scons.org/doc/2.0.1/HTML/scons-user/c4213.html)).
    - More information about SCons can be found [here](https://github.com/gslab-econ/ra-manual/wiki/SCons).
 - [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
 - [gslab_tools](https://github.com/gslab-econ/gslab_python) version 1.1.1 or later
 - [GSLab-modified Metropolis beamer theme](https://github.com/gslab-econ/gslab_latex)

The easiest way to install all the applications above is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac OS and [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/) on Linux, as they will set up the `PATH` variable for you, e.g., `brew install scons`.

#### To run:
 - The entire directory:
    - In the root directory, type `scons` in the command line. This should run everything that is flagged as being modified or with dependencies that have been modified.
 - A single directory of targets:
    - `scons build/data` will re-build the `build/data` folder if it is out of sync, without rebuilding other files.
 - A single target file:
    - `scons build/paper/paper.pdf` will re-run only the code needed to update `build/paper/paper.pdf` without rebuilding other files.

#### Copy the template:
In order to create a new repository using this template, either
- Fork this repository
- Create an empty repository in GitHub and clone it locally. Copy the contents of this template into the empty repository. Make sure to exclude the `.git` folder, but include the `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore` files. Re-run the entire directory using `Scons`. Commit and push to the new repository.
