Using the repository template
=============================



#### Pre-requisites:
 - Mac OS or Linux OS
 - [Stata MP](http://www.stata.com/statamp/)
    - Executable should also be added to the `PATH` environment variable so it is callable from the command line with `statamp`
 - [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
    - Executable should also be added to the `PATH` environment variable so it is callable from the command line with `Rscript`
 - [scons](http://scons.org/) 
 - [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/)
    - Executable should also be added to the `PATH` environment variable so it is callable from the command line with `lyx`
 - [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
 - [GSLab-modified Metropolis beamer theme](https://github.com/gslab-econ/gslab_latex)

 Installing the some of the applications above is easiest with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac OS and [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/) on Linux, as they will set up the PATH variable for you.
 
 E.g., `brew install scons`.
 
 Note: SCons can also be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) using `pip install --egg scons`.

#### To run:
 - The entire directory:
    - In the root directory, type `scons`. This should run everything that is flagged as being modified or with dependencies that have been modified.
 - A single directory of targets:
    - `scons output/data` will re-build the `output/data` folder if it is out of sync, without rebuilding other files.
 - A single target file:
    - `scons output/paper/paper.pdf` will re-run only the code needed to update `output/paper/paper.pdf` without rebuilding other files.


Individual scripts can be run directly within Stata and R if they are run in order.
